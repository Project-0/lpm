LPM Design Decisions
====================

ED001: The design of LPM is motivated by the understanding that it is a template for a larger project
(See Project[0] goals *needs reference*).  This means that we go forward with the assumption that we
cannot know all of the needs that software with this goal might require.  As such, everything is to
be built with the understanding that it *will* be extended.  This is a side-effect of Agile design
and rapid iteration: software is *going* to grow.  Design it to do that gracefully.
