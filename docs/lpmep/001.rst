Template Engine
===============

``lpm`` should have a template engine so that we can specify folder and file structures.  What I would like to do is create an index in ``/templates/`` as
a YAML file.  With the template expressed as a YAML file, we should be able to specify things like directories to make, files to touch (or even generate) and
other scripts to run when the project is first built.

What I want is a setup-and-go process similar to the one ``vagrant`` uses; where a single file is provided and one command can just make it happen.

Current Status
--------------

*  Working on unit tests, but currently, it is being problematic to create a test that can assert that `config.find_config_file` is capable of correctly
   finding and returning the right file.  So far, attempts to load things have either failed to the default, or loaded what appears to be an empty or
   un-parsable file.
